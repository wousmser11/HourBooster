# HourBooster & SingleBooster

HourBoostr and SingleBoostr are two applications designed to idle Steam games on user accounts. Each tool targets a different use case, allowing users to choose the solution that best fits their needs. Games do not need to be installed locally, but must be owned on the Steam account.

## HourBooster

HourBoostr functions as a standalone Steam client and requires Steam account credentials to operate. Its main advantage is the ability to boost multiple accounts at the same time without requiring Steam to be installed on the host machine. This makes it ideal for VPS usage and continuous operation.

HourBoostr is best suited for accounts that are not actively used. Since Steam does not allow simultaneous logins from different locations, you cannot play games or chat on the same account while HourBoostr is running.

> **Note:** HourBoostr does **not** support Steam Trading Card farming.  
> If you need this feature, use SingleBoostr instead.  
> For farming cards on multiple accounts, consider **Archi Steam Farm**.

## SingleBoostr

SingleBoostr is designed for users who want to boost a single Steam account while continuing to use Steam normally. Steam must be installed on the system.

While SingleBoostr is running, you can stay online, play other games, and chat with friends without interruption. It also includes built-in support for Steam Trading Card farming.
